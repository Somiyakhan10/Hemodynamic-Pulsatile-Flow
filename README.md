# Computational Hemodynamic Modeling of Pulsatile Arterial Blood Flow
This project simulates pulsatile blood flow in normal and dilated arteries using Python. 
It calculates velocity profiles, wall shear stress (WSS), Reynolds number, and oscillatory shear index (OSI) to analyze hemodynamic alterations related to aneurysm risk.
Graphs and results show how arterial dilation affects wall shear forces and flow stability.
